###############################################################################
#
# The following are the only settings you should need to change:
#
# TS_AS_FILENAME: This can help eliminate duplicate images during sorting.
# WARNING: Any two files with the same filename are automatically overwritten when
# this is on. FIXME: Handle filename collisions.
# TRUE: File will be renamed to the Unix timestamp and its extension.
# FALSE (any non-TRUE value): Filename is unchanged.
TS_AS_FILENAME=TRUE
#
# USE_LMDATE: If this is TRUE, images without EXIF data will have their Last Modified file
# timestamp used as a fallback. If FALSE, images without EXIF data are put in noexif/ for
# manual sorting.
# WARNING: Filename collisions are NOT handled when this is off. Files are automatically
# overwritten.
# FIXME: Handle collisions when this is off.
# Valid options are "TRUE" or anything else (assumes FALSE). FIXME: Restrict to TRUE/FALSE
#
USE_LMDATE=TRUE
#
# USE_FILE_EXT: The following option is here as a compatibility option as well as a bugfix.
# If this is set to TRUE, files are identified using FILE's magic, and the extension
# is set accordingly. If FALSE (or any other value), file extension is left as-is.
# CAUTION: If set to TRUE, extensions may be changed to values you do not expect.
# See the manual page for file(1) to understand how this works.
# NOTE: This option is only honored if TS_AS_FILENAME is TRUE.
#
USE_FILE_EXT=TRUE
#
# JPEG_TO_JPG: The following option is here for personal preference. If TRUE, this will
# cause .jpg to be used instead of .jpeg as the file extension. If FALSE (or any other
# value) .jpeg is used instead. This is only used if USE_FILE_EXT is TRUE and used.
#
JPEG_TO_JPG=FALSE
#
#
# The following is an array of filetypes that we intend to locate using find.
# Any imagemagick-supported filetype can be used, but EXIF data is only present in
# jpeg and tiff. Script will optionally use the last-modified time for sorting (see above)
# Extensions are matched case-insensitive. *.jpg is treated the same as *.JPG, etc.
# Can handle any file type; not just EXIF-enabled file types. See USE_LMDATE above.
#
FILETYPES=("*.jpg" "*.jpeg" "*.png" "*.tif" "*.tiff" "*.gif" "*.xcf")
#
# Optional: Prefix of new top-level directory to move sorted photos to.
# if you use MOVETO, it MUST have a trailing slash! Can be a relative pathspec, but an
# absolute pathspec is recommended.
# FIXME: Gracefully handle unavailable destinations, non-trailing slash, etc.
#
MOVETO=""

# End of settings. If you feel the need to modify anything below here, please share

# Assume find, grep, stat, awk, sed, tr, etc.. are already here, valid, and working.

# sorting. Minor output issue when run in this manner. Related to find -print0 below.

# Scanning (find) loop

# advantage performance-wise. Suggestions are welcome at the URL at the top.
